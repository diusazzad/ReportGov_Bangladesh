Project Title - ReportGOV BD

Project Description
# reportgovbangladesh - Open source idea that can ensure the citizen of Bangladesh can have the right service at the right time.

Documentation
# problem - The main problem is that government employees do not have any fear that if they do not give the citizen proper services, they will lose their job. For this, they do not provide the service they should provide the citizen. the citizen will not get the proper services and waste their time and money.

As an example as we see that, a citizen wants to go outside in our country and he/she needs to update something. As we can see the government services- the government employee do not care if the citizen needs to update. so this should be fixed in a way that the employee has to give the services in the proper way.

#solution- The solution is simple if the citizen is not getting the services, he/she will go to the system by application, search for the employee and submit their report and that report will monitor by the government ministry.
